repobuilder
====================
A patchwork of shell scripts that allow to build multiple RPM packages
and yum/dnf repositories in parallel.

Put your packages (i.e. spec files and sources) inside the packages/ directory,
each package in its own sub-directory. Run the main script to build.


Options
--------------------
--force-clean
  Remove the output directory at the start.
--help
  Print a help message and exit.
--no-refresh
  Do not update the container images.
  This can cause your build to fail if you added new packages
  or new BuildRequires to already existing packages.
--outernet
  Allow internet access during builds.
--package PKG
  Instead of all packages inside the package/directory, build only PKG.
  PKG can be a single name, or multiple names separated with a comma.
--parallel NUMBER
  Limit the number of simultaneously running containers to NUMBER.
  The default value is the same as the number of available CPUs.
  Use 0 for "no limit".
--release NUMBER
  Build the packages for the specified Fedora release.
  You can specify multiple numbers separated by a comma.
  The default value is "$N, $N-1", where \$N is the release you're running.
--rm
  Remove the container images after finishing.
  NOTE: This removes only repobuilder's images, not the base Fedora images.
--version
  Print version information and exit.
--with-debuginfo
  Enable debuginfo generation.
  By default, building debuginfo packages is disabled.
